### How to Work with the Source
I hope the source code for this app is useful for you as a reference or starting point for creating your own app. Here is some instructions to help you better build and run the code in Android Studio.

Clone the Repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/depers/Pocket.git
```

Check out the master branch:

```
git checkout master
```

Notice: If you want to review a different branch, replace the `master` with the name you want to checkout (if it does exist). Finally open the `Pocket/` directory in Android Studio.

Suggestion: It is better for you to update your Android Studio to version 2.3 when you open this project.

### To-dos
This project is still in progress. The project will be suspended for a year or so and is scheduled to restart in 2019. The official version 1.1 will be released for launch on Google Play and major application markets in China.
